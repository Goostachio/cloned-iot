# Manufacturing and processing - using IoT to improve the processing of food

Once food reaches a central hub or processing plant, it isn't always just shipped out to supermarkets. A lot of the time the food goes through a number of processing steps, such as sorting by quality. This is a process that used to be manual - it would start in the field when pickers would only pick ripe fruit, then at the factory the fruit would be ride a conver belt and staff would manually remove any bruised or rotten fruit. Having picked and sorted strawberries myself as a summer job during school, I can testify that this isn't a fun job.

More modern setups rely on IoT for sorting. Some of the earliest devices like the sorters from [Weco](https://wecotek.com) use LEDs and optical sensors to detect the quality of produce, rejecting green tomatoes for example. These can be deployed in harvesters on the farm itself, or in processing plants. The video below shows one of these machines in action.

As advances happen in AI, these machines can become more advanced, using models trained to distinguish between fruit and foreign objects such as rocks, dirt or insects. These models can also be trained to detect fruit quality, not just bruised fruit but early detection of disease or other crop problems.

In these 4 lessons you'll learn how to train image-based AI models to detect fruit quality, how to use these from an IoT device, and how to run these on the edge - that is on an IoT device rather than in the cloud.
